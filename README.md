With the beginning of AutoForm v7 there is no default theme included in AutoForm
in order to lower the package footprint and leave developers more options
for decision.

> Note for Meteor 3 and beyond
> This package is Meteor 3 compatible. Please check the latest releases
> on packosphere.com to see available alphas/betas and release candidates.

## Available themes

The following list contains the available themes. Note, that each has it's own
installation guide:

### Bootstrap 5

This theme supports the current latest Bootstrap 5.x version. If you want the
latest Bootstrap, this is your choice.

- [Bootstrap 5 theme installation guide and documentation](bootstrap5/README.md)

### Bootstrap 4

This theme supports the current latest Bootstrap 4.x version.

- [Bootstrap 4 theme installation guide and documentation](bootstrap4/README.md)


### Bootstrap 3

If you need backwards compatibility with Bootstrap 3 then we can assure you this
theme will work. It does neither depend on `twbs:bootstrap` (which is
deprecated and you shouldn't use it anyway) nor on the npm package.
This provides the best compatibility with most setups. Read the guide
on how to integrate with your BS3 installation.

- [Bootstrap 3 theme installation guide and documentation](bootstrap3/README.md)

### Plain

Most lightweight but without any styling. Rudimentary `class` attribute support
is available. Best fit for fast setups and small prototypes or projects that
require minimal styling.
