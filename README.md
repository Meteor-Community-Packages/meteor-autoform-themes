# Meteor Autoform Themes

Officially supported themes for `aldeed:autoform` v7 and beyond.

With the beginning of AutoForm v7 there is no default theme included in AutoForm
in order to lower the package footprint and leave developers more options
for decision.

## Available themes

The following list contains the available themes. Note, that each has it's own
installation guide:

### Plain

Most lightweight but without any styling. Rudimentary `class` attribute support
is available. Best fit for fast setups and small prototypes or projects that
require minimal styling.

- [Plain theme installation guide and documentation](./plain/README.md)  

### Bootstrap 3

If you need backwards compatibility with Bootstrap 3 then we can assure you this
theme will work. It does neither depend on `twbs:bootstrap` (which is 
deprecated and you shouldn't use it anyway) nor on the npm package. 
This provides the best compatibility with most setups. Read the guide
on how to integrate with your BS3 installation.

### Bootstrap 4

This theme supports the current latest Bootstrap 4.x version. If you want the
latest Bootstrap, this is your choice.
